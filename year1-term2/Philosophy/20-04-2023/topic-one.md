## Overview

- Medieval philosophy refers to the philosophy that existed in Western Europe during the Middle Ages, roughly from the 5th century to the 15th century.
- It was heavily influenced by Christian theology and the works of ancient philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle.

## Major Philosophers

- St. Augustine of Hippo: Known for his emphasis on the importance of faith in understanding God and the universe. His works include _Confessions_ and _The City of God_.
- St. Thomas Aquinas: Arguably the most influential philosopher of the Middle Ages. He sought to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy with Christian theology. His major work is _Summa Theologica_.
- William of Ockham: Known for his principle of parsimony, or Occam's Razor, which states that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one. His works include _Summa Logicae_ and _Quodlibeta_.

## Themes

- Scholasticism: A method of learning that emphasized dialectical reasoning and the use of logic to reconcile contradictory ideas. It was used to reconcile faith and reason in medieval theology.
- Natural Theology: The study of God and the universe through reason and observation. It was believed that God could be known through His creation.
- Nominalism: The belief that universals (such as "humanity" or "beauty") do not actually exist, but are only names or concepts created by humans.

Here's a table summarizing the major philosophers and their works:
