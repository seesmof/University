London has been working towards becoming the smartest city in the world since 2017, with the goal of achieving 80% of city journeys made by foot, by bicycle, or by public transport by 2041. The city has an estimated population of 10 million people within a 1,500 km2 area by 2030, making it the most advanced smart city in the world. The local government has invested heavily in AI, IoT, and 6G solutions to provide convenience and enhance interconnectedness between residents. Moreover, the city has a thriving technology sector, with 46,000 technology companies employing 240,000 people and generating £44 billion (€51 billion) in revenue.

Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the way cities operate and provide services to their citizens. While IoT innovations may be more exciting to the average citizen, blockchain can improve some of the most fundamental services powering urban areas, while also supporting IoT innovations. Innovative city, state, and country governments are already deploying the technology to improve public records management, peer-to-peer payments, and digital identity.
