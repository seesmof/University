As a personal fitness trainer, the first thing I would suggest is that you start by doing a full-body workout for 1-1.5 hours every day except for Sunday. The order of the exercises should be arranged in a way that targets different muscle groups and avoids overworking any one area. Here is a sample workout plan that you can follow:

1. Warm-up: 10-15 minutes of light cardio to get your heart rate up and your muscles warmed up. This could be jogging in place, jumping jacks, or using a stationary bike.

2. Squats: 3 sets of 12 reps. This exercise targets your legs, glutes, and core. Be sure to keep your back straight and your knees behind your toes.

3. Bench press: 3 sets of 12 reps. This exercise targets your chest, shoulders, and triceps. Be sure to use proper form and have a spotter if necessary.

4. Pull-ups: 3 sets of 8 reps. This exercise targets your back, biceps, and forearms. If you cannot do a full pull-up, use an assisted pull-up machine or resistance bands.

5. Lunges: 3 sets of 12 reps (6 on each leg). This exercise targets your legs, glutes, and core. Be sure to keep your knee behind your toes and your back straight.

6. Overhead press: 3 sets of 12 reps. This exercise targets your shoulders, triceps, and upper back. Be sure to use proper form and not arch your back.

7. Plank: 3 sets of 30-60 seconds. This exercise targets your core and helps improve your posture. Be sure to keep your back straight and your abs tight.

8. Cool-down: 10-15 minutes of stretching to help prevent injury and reduce soreness.

It's important to note that this is just a sample workout plan and may not be suitable for everyone. You should consult with a personal trainer or physician before starting any new exercise program. Additionally, it's important to listen to your body and adjust the number of reps or sets as needed to avoid injury.

In terms of diet, it's important to eat a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Avoid processed foods and sugary drinks, and drink plenty of water to stay hydrated. You may also want to consider tracking your calorie intake using a food diary or app to ensure you are getting the right amount of nutrients for your body.
